### What is Genshin Impact?
- **Genshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks.** Characters may have their strengths enhanced in various ways, such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips. In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses and challenges that reward highly valuable resources, such as Stormterror and the Electro Hypostasis, but claiming them uses up a currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time. Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level. The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives.

### Lore of the Game
- **Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat, composed of the seven major nations of Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya; each nation is ruled by a different god.** The mysterious floating island of Celestia is allegedly home to gods and mortals who have ascended to godhood through great, heroic feats. Underground lie the ruins of the nation of Khaenri'ah which was destroyed by gods 500 years before the events of the game. Unlike the seven major nations, Khaenri'ah was not ruled over by a god. The player character, the Traveler (male or female, depending on the player's choice), is separated from their twin and becomes trapped in Teyvat. They are joined by a companion, Paimon, as they journey through Teyvat in search of their lost sibling. Although players can choose the name they want to be referred by, the Traveler's sibling refers to the Traveler by either Aether or Lumine if the Traveler is male or female, respectively.

### Mechanics
- **Genshin Impact is an anime style, open-world RPG with an action-based combat system. The game utilizes a party system that uses different characters’ attacks and abilities.** Genshin also utilizes “gacha” mechanics, meaning players earn in-game currency (or pay) in order to earn things like characters and weapons.

### Adventure Rank

- **Adventure Rank (AR) is a player account progression system in Genshin Impact that is raised through Adventure EXP.** Upon reaching certain Adventure Ranks, players will be able to ascend their world to the next World Level, either automatically or by completing an Ascension Quest. When a player's World Level increases, it increases the difficulty and rewards of Monsters, Bosses, and Ley Line Outcrops.

### Ascension

- After you've been playing with a character in Genshin Impact for a certain amount of time, you'll hit a wall where the character and its weapons **cannot** increase in level or stats. **Ascension allows you to continue a character or weapon's progress by unlocking one of their talents or passive skills.** Do that, and you'll continue making more progress in one of the best Android games available.
- **Characters and weapons can only ascend if the right materials and requirements are met.** You can't make it into the high-level dungeons unless you take the time to ascend your characters and weapons.

### Wishing System/Gacha

- **The gacha system is a mechanic in any game where players can unlock featured characters or weapons by making a random draw from a pool of items.** The term is based on the popular Japanese toy dispensers called Gachapon (Gashapon). It requires the use of in-game currencies to roll for a chance to capture a prize. A game may feature several prize pools with different weighted options. The more you draw from a specific pool, the more you can increase your chances of getting the better item.

### Banners

- In Genshin Impact, the gacha system is called Wishes or more popularly known as **Banners**.
- The game features two types of Wishes: there’s the **permanent Standard Wish called Wanderlust Invocation**. The second one is a **Limited-time Event Wish for Characters and Weapons**. 
- The **Beginner’s Wish Banner** introduces the Wish system for new Travelers and expires after completing 20 wishes. It comes with a 20% discount wherein the cost of a 10 pull is 8 Acquaint Fate. It guarantees the player to receive Noelle (on the first 10-wish set), while the second set **secures a 4 or 5-star character**.
- **Ideally, you may want to aim for 5-star characters and weapons, as they are regarded as the most powerful on the list.** The only question that remains is: how much would you have to spend to obtain them? While some players may be limited to a specific budget, Genshin’s gacha still allows them to play the game for free.

### Drop Rates
- For Character Event Wishes, the rate of **pulling a 5-Star Character is at 0.6% (Base Rate)**. For the Weapon Event Wishes, **the rate for a 5-Star Weapon stands at 0.7% (Base Rate)**. These rates also come with a corresponding average rate, including **Pity**. Note that the Wish system offers pity rolls to players who have tried multiple times to pull a specific item.

### Pity System
- **The pity system in Genshin Impact essentially ensures that you receive certain ranks of characters after wishing a certain number of times.** Pity can be tracked by clicking the History button on the Wish page. From there, just count the number of pulls since your last 5-star character. The number of wishes changes between banners, though, so let’s take a look at the pity system in place for each banner.
- Genshin Impact’s 5-star characters have some of the worst drop rates, with a measly 0.6% chance of being pulled. Thankfully, if you’re out of luck and can’t seem to pull one, you'll be pleased to hear that you’re **guaranteed to win a 5-star character on your 90th wish on the Character Event banner.**
